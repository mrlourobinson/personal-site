    <h2>Hey! 👋</h2>

    <p>I'm Lou Robinson, a designer and visual journalist on the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/profiles/lou-robinson">CNN Data and Graphics team</a>. I work on stories ranging from climate change impacts to breaking news, creating maps, charts, and interactive graphics that help people understand complex issues.</p>

    <p>After studying Graphic Design at Falmouth University, I worked in various roles, ranging from fashion startups, financial reporting, and the UK government. I spent nearly a decade combining design, data and cartography in "rooms filled with news", before finally making my way into journalism and a real newsroom. I love to combine design, data and mapping with storytelling on topics that really matter.</p>

    <p>I'm originally from Teesside in North East England, and currently based in London.</p>
